# Modified-Hybrid-Astar
This is the code for Voronoi Based Hybrid A* for Tractor-Trailer Systems. 

The hybrid astar is integrated with the [ROS Navigation Stack](http://wiki.ros.org/navigation) in order to use the [Timed Elastic Band](http://wiki.ros.org/teb_local_planner) local planner. The global planner used with it is the Voronoi Based Hybrid Astar.

Instructions for setting up and running the packages can be found [here](https://github.com/tanujthakkar/Voronoi-Based-Hybrid-Astar).
